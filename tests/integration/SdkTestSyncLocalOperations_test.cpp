/**
 * @brief Renames A to B (B already exists, so it's replaced) and creates a new A. After the move
 * and the transfer finish, repeat the operation.
 *
 * The first time that a move operation takes place, the sync debris folder is not created yet,
 * affecting the sequence of requests sent to the API:
 *    1. The request to move (rename) the node to-be-displaced along with the request will be sent
 * to create the daily SyncDebris.
 *    2. Action packets are received, node to-be-displaced is not yet fully updated as there are now
 * 2 duplicated nodes in the cloud, the renamed one and the old one that still needs to be sent to
 * debris.
 *    3. After receiving the action packets, the request to move to debris the node-to-be-displaced
 * will be sent.
 *    4. Immediately after, the move operation completion will be checked: the row.cloudNode still
 * has the old handle (as it not has yet been moved to debris, that cloudNode is outdated). So the
 * move operation is reset for evaluation.
 *    5. The operation to move the node-to-be-displaced to debris will be finished, but the
 * checkMoves will wait a bit (it considers the file is still changing, as it has stats that it
 * didn't have before).
 *    6. When the checkMoves takes place again, all the move operation in the cloud has been
 * completed, so it doesn't need to start a move operation again.
 *
 * The second time a move operation takes place, the sync debris is created already:
 *    1. The request to move (rename) the node-to-be-displaced will the request to move the
 * node-to-be-displaced to the daily SyncDebris.
 *    2. Action packets are received, updating the current cloud nodes accordingly, and the
 * displaced node with the previous handle does not exist anymore.
 *    3. Immediately after, the move operation completion will be checked: the row.cloudNode has the
 * updated handle.
 *    4. The move operation is completed from the sync engine: it takes all the data from the
 * sourceSyncNode, including the transfer in flight, and marks the row as synced.
 *
 * Expectations are that only one upload transfer (the one to create the new A) is started in each
 * iteration:
 *    1. First iteration, there is a move operation which is cancelled. The upload transfer is never
 * moved to another sync node.
 *    2. Second iteration, the move operation is completed from the sync engine, and the upload
 * transfer is moved to the target sync node (B). The fix must prevent this from happening for this
 * scenario, avoiding a new upload to be started again from the new file A.
